        The actor then inquired about Malavika Mohanan's passion in acting and invited him to star with his son Dulquer
        Salmaan in a forthcoming Malayalam film.
        Before you go to the audition, Malavika thought about the proposition and agreed to the terms of appearing in
        <b>Pattam Pole (2013),</b> gradually learning about the acting process as the filming continued. Due to the
        illness
        of the original costume designer, Mohanan also served as his own designer for the project. This love drama
        depicted a young Tamil Brahmin's connection with a Christian girl, but it got mixed reviews and a dismal box
        office result. A Rediff.com commentator pointed out that Mohanan’s “lively teenage behavior is
        far from perfect, but shows hope”, while critics of The Times of India considered her “decent”. With a passion
        for fashion, he established "The Scarlet Window," an Indian cultural fusion apparel line.
        Her second film, <b>"Nirnayakam" (2015),</b> played by Mohanan as a ballerina, was well received, but it also
        received tepid commercial response. During this time, Naale was cast as a tribal girl in another film starring
        Fahadh Faasil, but she was dropped in the middle of filming. In 2016, Mohanan and newcomer Prithvi
        produced his first Kannada film <b>Naanu Mattu Varalakshmi (2016).</b> Despite its low-key release at the box
        office, the film received rave reviews, and Mohanan's portrayal of Varalakshmi's protagonist was praised by
        critics. He then played the role of a police officer in the police thriller <b>"The Great Father" (2017),
        </b>where he performed with actors including Mammootty, Arya, and Sneha.The picture was well-received and did
        well in theatres. </p>

      <p class="wow fadeInUp" style="text-align: justify;" data-wow-duration="0.5s" data-wow-delay="0.3s">
        Malavika Mohanan made her acting debut in Majid Majidi's drama <b>"Beyond the Clouds,"</b> in which she played
        Tara, a destitute teenager from Mumbai's Doby Ghat neighbourhood (2017). After her successful audition, Majidi
        put
        her ahead of the famous actress Deepika Padukone and Kangana Ranate in this role, she played the newcomer
        Isaan Hart's sister. He expressed his pleasure to work with Majidi early in his career, especially considering
        that he often had to study and write articles about his films during his undergraduate studies.In order to
        establish the right impression of a slum dweller, Mohanan dropped eight kg over the fifteen days of filming the
        jail scene and opted not to wash his hair for a few days. The film was screened at various
        international film festivals and then screened around the world in April 2018. Mohanan's performance received
        positive reviews, and Filmfare critics claimed that "Malavika Mohanan was born in front of the camera." A
        critic of The Times of India claimed that it was “fascinated by its honest performance” and “tightly walked
        far between enthusiasm and melodrama”, while the Hollywood Reporter called it “solid ".
        In mid-2018, she inked a deal to feature in Karthik Subbaraj's next film <b>"Petta(2019)"</b>, with Rajinikanth,
        Vijay Sethupathi, and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. This film marked her first Tamil project, and
        Mohanan hired a Tamil-speaking tutor to help her practice her lines. Then, she appeared with Vijay in
        <b>Master of Tamil Action Thriller (2021),</b> where she played the role of University Professor Charulatha.
        It became the highest-grossing movie in his career.
        Unlike Dhanush, Malavika has been cast in the untitled Tamil film helmed by Karthick Naren, as well as the
        Hindi film Yudhra, opposite Siddhant Chaturvedi.
        The latter is set to begin operations in the summer of 2022. </p>

            <p>Malavika is trying to raise this money for the education of children in these tribal areas of Wayanad,
              Kerala state. Smartphones and laptops are in great demand for students of Odappallam Secondary School,
              Wayanad, Kerala State, who belong to 22 tribal communities from all over there. Because of the
              lockdown, the only way to continue their education is through online studies. With your donations,
              we will be able to provide at least one laptop and one smartphone per tribal community, which will
              benefit 221 students overall. Our dream is to ensure every child has one device to study, but we
              know that even these two devices shared by 10 children are a great start. I I am grateful to you
              and invite your beautiful hearts to donate.</p>

              closest companions at that point told me that his mother never let him drink tea since she had this
              abnormal conviction that drinking tea obscured ones’ skin complexion, and when he inquired for tea once
              she told him (alluding to me) “If you drink tea, you may ended up dull like her”. He was a reasonable
              maharashtrian boy and I was a wheat-ish cleaned malayalee young lady. The complexion disparity we had had
              never indeed happened to me up until that point. This cleared out me perplexed because it was the primary

          <p class="mt-3">She's always been outspoken about her love of wildlife and the environment.
            It's no surprise, then, that Malavika Mohanan is now striving to help animals in need of refuge and safety.
            The Master actress is in talks with animal rescue and rehabilitation centres about adopting and caring for
            animals. “I grew up in the bush and have always been fascinated by wildlife.
            During the lockdown, I began to consider how I could contribute to the environment, nature, and all living
            species who rely on them.
            That's where the idea came from, and I'm trying to expand on it,” she says, before going on to discuss what
            she's working on. “I've often wondered what I can do on my own to help wildlife conservation and make a
            difference.
            We must be cognizant of how our actions affect other species at a time when there is so much poaching and
            forests are being destroyed.
            I'm not a great fan of zoos, and I don't like the concept of animals being confined or put on display in
            places where they're likely to be mistreated.“For example, if an injured tiger is unable to hunt and is on
            the verge of starvation, they will save him and care for him until he is restored to health. </p>

          <p class="mt-3">From the moment the creator of Lokesh Kanagaraj's Master announced Malavika Mohanan as the
            heroine, she became a fan favorite of Vijay. Since then, they have been celebrating her, confessing their
            love in the comments section of her photos and posts on social media. In one case, after an annoyed Malawika
            suggested sexism in a fan-made poster on Twitter, she was verbally abused on the social media platform, and
            another fan quickly made a picture of her Different posters that I like. Similarly, a few months later, when
            one of the tweeple described her as overrated, one of her fans wrote on Twitter: "Underrated or overrated,
            we will always love Malawika."
            After the movie was released , I am also very happy to receive positive feedback from fans through social
            media. However, his expression in key scenes in the film was influenced by trolls and memes, and he
            immediately became popular. She answered the same question in an interesting way on Twitter. She tweeted:
            "My own memefest is a bit late, but this is a funny guy. Share some of my favorite things that break me (I
            laugh when I see the toothpaste) If you can't laugh, life is boring too for you, right? "</p>

            fan of Bollywood superstar Tiger, according to Pinkvilla.
            She even related an event from when they went to see a Tiger Shroff film as a team while filming Master.
            Vijay felt ecstatic and clapped him on the back, screaming, "Thalaivaa!"
            Vijay later told her that he likes the young actor, she said.
            We're curious to hear Tiger's reaction to Malavika's intriguing disclosure regarding the Tamil superstar.
            Tiger's father, actor Jackie Shroff, had previously appeared alongside Thalapathy Vijay in Atlee's 2019 hit
